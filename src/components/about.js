Before starting my journey in Coding I was in the United States Army, after leaving the military I decided to learn a skill. That skill was software engineering, So 6 months ago I joined the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp, it has been challenging forsure but none the less I Love coding and cant wait to see where my journey in coding takes me. </p>
